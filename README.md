# Property Tycoon

Monopoly as a Service :P

## Getting Started

- The game uses `yarn` as a package manager, be sure to have Node.js and yarn installed before trying to run the game.
- From the terminal, move into the project directory and install the dependencies for the project using the `yarn` command.
- Now run `yarn build` to build and bundle the project.
- To launch the build, run `yarn start` and the server will start on `localhost:3000`
